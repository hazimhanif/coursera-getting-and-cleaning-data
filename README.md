Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
Project of [Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning)

Introduction
------------
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The R script called run_analysis.R in this project does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
